          Ever since his groundbreaking hits The Show and LaDi DaDi, legendary
          hip-hop icon Doug E. Fresh has captivated audiences around the world
          with
          his vocal simulations of drums and other musical instruments as well
          as
          being a producer, artist mentor, TV & film personality,
          businessperson,
          and all-around global music legend. Dubbed an “artistic trailblazer”
          by
          MTV, Doug is the creator of the beatbox art form.
        </p>,

        <p>
          Doug E. Fresh is dubbed the “World’s Greatest Entertainer” and the
          “Original Human Beatbox,” but over the course of his 30-year career,
          he
          has established himself as so much more, including: global icon,
          artistic
          trailblazer, television personality and producer, successful
          businessperson, and activist. Fresh has forever etched himself into
          the
          annals of music history with his creation of the beatbox art form,
          whereby
          he vocally simulates the sound of drums and other musical instruments
          with
          stunning accuracy. Today, his skill and talents have resulted in an
          enduring international hip-hop legacy that continues to break new
          ground.
        </p>,

        <p>
          Among the many awards Fresh has accumulated over his career, he is an
          inaugural Hip Hop Hall of Fame inductee, Source Awards’ Lifetime
          Achievement honoree and a BET Hip Hop Awards Icon honoree. A mentor
          and
          inspiration to hip-hop and R&B artists alike, Doug’s prolific career
          is
          still going strong with hundreds of live performances and personal
          appearances in film and television each year.
        </p>,

        <p>
          As a pioneering entertainer, Fresh possesses the unrivaled ability to
          captivate an audience with or without a musical backing track and has
          performed at the request of Saints, foreign dignitaries, and US
          Presidents. As a television personality and producer, he has appeared
          as a
          performer and musical mentor on Fox’s “American Idol,” hosted HBO’s
          “Bad
          Boys of Comedy,” served as one of three celebrity judges on BET’s
          “Showtime at the Apollo,” and earned three consecutive executive
          producer
          credits for his work on BET’s newly reprised “Soul Train Awards.”
        </p>,

        <p>
          To date, Doug E. Fresh stands as one of the most actively touring
          musicians across all genres, averaging a whopping 200 live, domestic
          performances per year for the past two decades. A tireless artist who
          remains highly relevant and on the pulse of innovation, Fresh will
          continue to expand his empire. In the process, one thing is certain –
          he
          will always remain true to giving back through his gift. “I always
          lived
          my life saying I don’t want to be financially rich and spiritually
          bankrupt,” he says. “So most of my decisions lean toward what’s better
          for
          the spiritual growth of others and for myself, and toward creating the
          best celebrations of life. When I make music, I’ve always been about
          trying to elevate the culture. Hip-hop is supposed to uplift, to
          educate
          people on a higher level, and to make change.”
        </p>,

        <p>
          Doug E. Fresh’s Memo® gives a never-before-seen look at Doug writing
          in
          the book where he writes lyrics for his songs. Check out his Memo®
          Story

          Alzheimer’s Foundation.
