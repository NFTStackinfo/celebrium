        <p>
          Of Course! Our goal is to help make owning Celebrity NFT memorabilia
          as easy as possible. We've partnered with NFTpay in order to make your
          purchases fast, simple and secure.

  {
    question: 'When will I get my NFTs?',
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          Your NFTs will appear immediately after purchase. If you purchased
          with a credit card, they'll show up in your NFTpay wallet. If you paid
          using your Metamask wallet, they'll show up there.
        </p>

  {
    question: 'Do I need a crypto wallet?',
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          No, you don't. We’ve partnered with NFTpay to make your NFT purchase
          as easy as possible. When you purchase with a credit card, you’ll
          receive a free account and a wallet from NFTpay where you can view
          your NFTs.
        </p>
      </>

  },
  {
    question:
      'I have a crypto wallet. Can I use that instead?',
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          Yes. We currently support MetaMask and will be adding other wallet
          integrations soon. If you want to purchase with MetaMask, you will
          need to use MATIC to make the purchase.
        </p>

  },
  {
    question:
      'Can I transfer my NFTs to another wallet?',
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          Yes, you can! The wallet you transfer your Celebrium® Genesis NFTs to
          must work with Polygon and support NFTs. Note that there may be a very
          small transaction fee (usually less than a few dollars) to transfer
          your Celebrium® Genesis NFTs from one wallet to another wallet.
        </p>

  },
  {
    question:
      'Can I sell my NFTs on OpenSea or other NFT Marketplaces?',
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          Yes! While we encourage you to hold onto your Celebrium® Genesis NFTs
          to get continued access to benefits, prizes, and drawings, you can
          sell your NFTs on any NFT marketplace that supports Polygon.
        </p>

  {
    question:
      'Can I mix and match NFTs and still get the benefits?',
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          Absolutely! If you own 10 or more of the Celebrium® Genesis NFTs,
          contact our Support Team so that we can add you to our drawings. If
          you own 40 or more Celebrium® Genesis NFTs, contact our Support Team
          so that we can get you scheduled for your guaranteed appearance on an
          entertainment production as well as send you your physically framed
          NFT image.

    question:
      'How do I get my physically framed NFT image with a commemorative plaque?',
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          After you purchase 40 or more Celebrium® Genesis NFTs, simply contact
          our Support Team and we'll arrange to send you your framed NFT.
        </p>

  {
    question:
      'What entertainment production can I be part of?',
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          We've partnered with American Stories TV which produces TV shows that
          support American family values.
        </p>
      </>
    )
  },
  {
    question:
      'How many times can I be an extra or walk-on in an entertainment production?',
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          For each 40 Celebrium® Genesis NFTs you purchase, you're guaranteed an
          appearance as an extra or walk-on in an entertainment production. As
          long as you hold more than 10 Celebrium® Genesis NFTs you’ll also be
          automatically entered into a drawing for appearance as an extra or
          walk-on. Drawing entrants can win any number of times but you must own
          at least 10 Celebrium® Genesis NFTs at the time of the drawing.
        </p>
      </>
    )
  },
  {
    question:
      'How often will drawings be held?',
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          We will hold a minimum of one drawing per year but our goal is to have
          at least four drawings per year. Each drawing will have at least one
          winner but could have multiple winners.
        </p>

  {
    question:
      'What is MetaMask?',
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          MetaMask is a very popular software cryptocurrency wallet used to send
          and receive Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies (like MATIC) and tokens
          (like NFTs). You can set up MetaMask as a Chrome plugin on your
          desktop or as an app on your phone.
        </p>
      </>
    )
  },
  {
    question:
      'What is MATIC?',
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          MATIC is Polygon's native cryptocurrency, and can be used to buy NFTs
          and much more.
        </p>
      </>
    )
  },
  {
    question:
      'What is Polygon?',
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          Polygon is an Ethereum-based solution that has faster transactions and
          lower fees than Ethereum. MATIC, Polygons native cryptocurrency, is
          used for purchasing NFTs and more. You can buy or sell MATIC via
          exchanges like Coinbase or Kraken.
        </p>
      </>
    )
  },
  {
    question:
      'What is Ethereum',
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain. The native
          cryptocurrency on Ethereum is Ether (ETH or E). The Etherium
          blockchain is more expensive to use than Polygon, which is why we've
          chosen Polygon for our Celebrium® Genesis Collection of NFTs.
